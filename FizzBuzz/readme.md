# FizzBuzz

Write a program that accepts a number greater than 0 and prints the number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## New Requirements
1. The program extends its behaviour to returning 'Foo' when input is divisible by 2
2. The program extends its behaviour to accepting a list of integers
