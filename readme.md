## TDD
## SOLID design principles
While the implementation evolves towards addressing the problem, SOLID design principles are pursued as possible. Thus, we use such kata to train on good daily programming habit.

## Implementing the same Kata in more than one language
It is interesting to see how could one be able to work towards the same solution in different languages. Here, I am keen to see how it really differs among Scala, Kotlin, Java and Erlang. Of course, one cannot test everthing. Here, I focus on Pattern Matching. 

``` 
A uTDD pattern is:
Break it, fix it, commit, refactor if necessary, and so on.
```
